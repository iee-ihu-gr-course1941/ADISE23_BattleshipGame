            <h1>GAME RULES</h1>
            <div class="sect">Characteristics and Aim/Goal:</div>
            <p>Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which 
                the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's 
                warships and sink them. The gameplay is straightforward. Each 
                player hides ships on a grid containing vertical and horizontal 
                space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column 
                coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a 
                square that contains a ship. The game board each player gets has two 
                grids. The first grid is used by the player to "hide" the location of 
                his own ships, while the second is used to record the shots fired toward 
                the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses.
            </p>
            <div class="sect">Setting up the Game:</div>
            <p>Each player receives a game board and five ships of varying lengths. Each 
                ship is inserted in grid's coordinates and there is a supply of hit and miss 
                markers (white and red dots). The five ships are: <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Carrier</strong>, which has five holes. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Battleship</strong>, which has four holes. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Cruiser</strong>, which has three holes. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Submarine</strong>, which has three holes. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Destroyer</strong>, which has two holes. <br/>
                Players' target grids back up to one another vertically so that neither player can see 
                his opponent's ocean grid and ship locations. Before the game starts, each opponent 
                secretly places their own five ships on the ocean grid by laying out their ships and 
                placing them into the holes on the grid. Each ship must be placed horizontally or 
                vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't hang off the grid. 
                Ships can touch each other, but they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot 
                change the position of the ships after the game begins.
            </p>
            <div class="sect">Gameplay:</div>
            <p>Players take turns firing shots to attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships. On your turn, 
                fire a shot by clicking a coordinate on opponent's target grid. After you fire the shot a 
                response appears: "miss" (red dot) if there is no ship there, or "hit" (white dot) if you 
                have correctly guessed a space that is occupied by a ship. If you succeed a "hit" then you 
                keep playing, otherwise it's opponent's turn. As the game proceeds, the red dots will gradually 
                identify the size and location of your opponent's ships. When it is your opponent's turn to fire 
                shots at you, each time one of your ships receives a hit, will appear a red dot into the hole on 
                the ship corresponding to your grid space. When one of your ships has every slot filled with red dots, 
                then your ship is sunk. <strong>The first player to sink all five of their opponent's ships wins the game.</strong> 
            </p>
