            <h1>GAME RULES</h1>
            <div class="sect">Characteristics and Aim/Goal:</div>
            <p>Battleship Game is a board game for two players in which 
                the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's 
                warships and sink them. The gameplay is straightforward. Each 
                player hides ships on a grid/table containing vertical and horizontal 
                space coordinates. Players take turns by hitting a coordinate
                on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that 
                contains a part of a ship. Each player can see two grids/tables. 
                The first grid is used by the player to "hide" the location of 
                his own ships, while the second is used to record the shots fired toward 
                the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses.
            </p>
            <div class="sect">Setting up the Game:</div>
            <p>Each player receives a game board and five ships of varying lengths. Each 
                ship is inserted by the user into the table's coordinates that he chose. 
                The five ships are: <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Carrier</strong>, which has five points. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Battleship</strong>, which has four points. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Cruiser</strong>, which has three points. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Submarine</strong>, which has also three points. <br/>
                <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Destroyer</strong>, which has two points. <br/>
                Each player cannot see the locations of their opponent's ships. Before the game starts, 
                each opponent secretly places their own five ships on the ocean grid by insterting them in the
                corresponding table. Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces
                —not diagonally— and the ships can't be placed off the grid. Ships can touch each other, but 
                they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot change the position of the ships after the game begins.
            </p>
            <div class="sect">Gameplay:</div>
            <p>Players take turns firing shots to attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships. On your turn, 
                fire a shot by clicking a coordinate on opponent's target table. After you fire the shot a 
                response appears: "miss" (white color) if there is no ship there, or "hit" (red color) if you have 
                correctly guessed a space that is occupied by a ship. As the game proceeds, the red dots will 
                gradually identify the size and location of your opponent's ships. When it is your opponent's turn 
                to fire shots at you, each time one of your ships receives a hit, will appear a red color on the 
                coordinate of the ship corresponding to the point of your table. When one of your ships has every slot 
                filled with red dots, then your ship is sunk. <strong>The first player to sink all five of their opponent's ships wins the game.</strong>
